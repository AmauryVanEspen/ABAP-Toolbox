- ABAP Code snippets for everyday use - 
---------------------------------------

I've seen many ABAP developers with tons of .txt files that have custom developments they made to solve a particular issue they knew they would face in the future. What if we had a repository with all that custom code, available to anyone, 24/7? That's what ABAP Toolbox is (or at least, what I want it to be in the near future =] ).

---------------------------------------
-         Can I Contribute?           -
---------------------------------------

Of course you can! You can either do a pull request using Github, or send me the .nugg file by mail, or even send me a comment through my ABAP Website: http://abapzombie.com/ . Also create the README file explaining what your code can do.


---------------------------------------
-         What? .NUGG File?           - 
---------------------------------------

SAPLINK is the biggest Open Source project from the ABAP Community. It's basically an program that helps you "transport" your code between two differente application servers, using a XML file. There are tons of blogs on the internet explaining how to use SAPLINK and create a .NUGG file.

SAPLink Project Website: http://code.google.com/p/saplink/ (you can also find instructions in there). 

If you've never heard of SAPLink, learn to use it NOW. It can save you TONS of time!


---------------------------------------
- Why you're not using SAP's CodeEx?  - 
---------------------------------------
CodeEx uses SVN, and I think git is better for Social Coding than SVN.
